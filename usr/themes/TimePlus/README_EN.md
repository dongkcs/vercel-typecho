# TimePlus For Typecho

[中文 README](README.md)

![](/info/timeplus.webp)

The original author hasn't maintained this theme for two years and has moved to Wordpress. I personally really like this theme and want to iterate and optimize it more quickly, so I'm planning to continue maintaining this theme. Based on the original author's [Time theme](https://github.com/wclk/time), I'm updating it to create a brand new TimePlus.

The name "TimePlus" signifies the hope to extend this theme further.

The theme may reflect personal design preferences based on the original Time theme. If you don't like these changes, you can try the original theme.
